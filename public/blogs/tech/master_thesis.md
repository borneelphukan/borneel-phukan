description: "Modern web applications, controlled by large corporations, raise concerns over data security and user control. Decentralized web solutions address this but struggle with trust in external data. The ConTED framework enhances trust evaluation using Content Analysis, Context Analysis, and Behavioral Analysis, focusing on Specificity, Likelihood, and Topic Classification. This thesis integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into ConTED for RDF data preprocessing and content analysis, demonstrating feasibility through a prototype and use case evaluation."
